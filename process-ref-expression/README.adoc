This XML schema defines and documents BPMN 2.0 extension elements and
attributes to dynamically invoke re-usable sub-processes from BPMN processes.
This schema has been derived from the CMMN 1.1 Process Task.

Call Acitivites using this extension element or the attribute bpmn:calledElement
to reference another process, should be depicted with a "Chevron" Icon symbol
in the upper left corner similar to a CMMN Process Task.
